'''Create a BankAccount class with private attributes account_number, account_holder, and balance.
Implement methods:
deposit(amount) - increases the balance by the specified amount if itâ€™s positive.
withdraw(amount) - decreases the balance if there are enough funds.
get_balance() - returns the current balance.
Test your class by creating a BankAccount instance, making deposits and withdrawals, and checking the balance.'''
